        Hey ðŸ‘‹, I`m Pranav Choudhary,
        I am a Computer science undergraduate pursuing my B.tech degree from IIIT Jabalpur.
     \n
        I dabble in Android, Kotlin, Java, Flutter, UI/UX and spend most of my time automating my life via literally living inside the terminal .
        I am eager to constantly learn new things.
      \n
        At the moment, my focus is on the kotlin language features, RxJava and RxAndroid, architectural patterns on Android (MVVM, MVP, etc.)
        and of course I am always up for trying out the newest Android libraries.
\n
        In case you are interested in cooperation with me, do not hesitate to contact me
